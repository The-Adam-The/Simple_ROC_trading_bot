# Simple_ROC_trading_bot
Basic ROC bot

Built using the guide from the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQkaJ207xYI from Algovibes
I have made some amendments to accomodate easier changes using variables.

Trading is risky and this bot is extremely simple. If you use this bot you do so at your own risk. Do not investment more than you can afford to lose.
I am not financial adviser.

I will be adding features to this bot as I follow the rest of Algovibes videos.
